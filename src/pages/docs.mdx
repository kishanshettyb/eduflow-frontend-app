# Nextra

Nextra is a framework on top of Next.js, that lets you build content focused websites. It has all the great features from Next.js, plus extra power to create Markdown-based content with ease.

### Installation

```js copy
yarn add nextra nextra-theme-docs
```

Create the following `next.config.mjs` file in your project's root directory:

```js copy
import nextra from 'nextra'
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */

const nextConfig = {}
const withNextra = nextra({
  theme: 'nextra-theme-docs',
  themeConfig: './theme.config.jsx'
})

export default withNextra(nextConfig)
```

### Create Docs Theme Config Text

Lastly, create the corresponding `theme.config.jsx` file in your project's root directory. This will be used to configure the Nextra Docs theme:

```js copy
export default {
  logo: <span>EduFLow Documentation</span>,
  project: {
    link: 'https://github.com/shuding/nextra'
  }
  // ... other theme options
}
```

### Ready to Go!

Now, you can create your first MDX page as pages/docs.mdx:

```js copy
# Welcome to EduFlow Documentation

EduFlow Docs !!!
```
