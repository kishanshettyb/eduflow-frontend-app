# Installation

System Requirements: Node.js 18.17 or later.

```js copy
npx create-next-app@latest
```

### Setup Eslint, Prettier and Conventiona Commit

Installing Eslint and Prettier:

```js copy
 yarn add --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier
```

Now, on the root of the project create a file named .eslintrc.js Note(Already Next Js projected created `.eslintrc.json` file rename it to `.eslintrc.js` )

```js copy
module.exports = {
  extends: ["next", "prettier", "next/core-web-vitals"],
  plugins: ["react", "react-hooks", "prettier"],
  rules: {
    quotes: ["error", "single"],
    semi: ["error", "always"],
    "no-unused-vars": [
      "error",
      {
        args: "after-used",
        caughtErrors: "none",
        ignoreRestSiblings: true,
        vars: "all",
      },
    ],
    "prefer-const": "error",
    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "error",
  },
};
```

Now, on the root of the project create a file named `prettier.config.js`

```js copy
module.exports = {
  singleQuote: true,
  arrowParens: "always",
  trailingComma: "none",
  jsxBracketSameLine: true,
  printWidth: 100,
  tabWidth: 2,
  semi: false,
};
```

Now, let's install Husky and create a hook named `.husky/pre-commit` on the root of our project running the following command:

```js copy
npx husky-init && npm install
npm install husky --save-dev
npx husky install
```

After running the command above, husky will create a hook on the folder .husky named `pre-commit`, and inside it will be prompt a script like this:

```js copy
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"
npm test
```

Now add a new script on the package.json: This script will active hooks automatically on installation

```js copy
"prepare": "husky && husky install"
```

Installing and creating the lint-staged on the project:

```js copy
npm install --save-dev lint-staged
```

Change npm test to npx lint-staged on husky hooks named `pre-commit` installed before, your code looks like this:

```js copy
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"
npx lint-staged
```

Now, create a new config on the `package.json` of lint-staged:

```js copy
{
...
"lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}": [
      "eslint --fix",
      "eslint",
      "prettier --write"
    ],
    "*.json": [
      "prettier --write"
    ]
  },
...
}
```

Installing Commitizen on the project:

```js copy
yarn add --save-dev commitizen cz-conventional-changelog @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
```

Create a new file on the root of the project named `commitlint.config.js`, and paste the following code:

```js copy
module.exports = { extends: ["@commitlint/config-conventional"] };
```

Now add a new commitizen script on the package.json:

```js copy
{
...
"config": {
  "commitizen": {
    "path": "./node_modules/cz-conventional-changelog"
  }
},
...
}
```

Now add a new commitizen script on the package.json:

```js copy
"scripts": {
...
  "commit": "git-cz",
...
}
```

Now, let's create two more hooks inside of the folder that was created before named .husky on the root of the project:
Create the first file named `prepare-commit-msg` and past the following code:

```js copy
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

exec < /dev/tty && npx git-cz --hook || true
```

Create the second file named `commit-msg` and past the following code:

```js copy
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npx commitlint --edit $1
```

It's important to run this command before commits:

```js copy
chmod +x .husky/*
```

After doing the steps above your folder will be like this:

Now, you can run on the terminal, `git add .` and then `git commit`, lint-staged will
check your code, so if all code is okay, then commitizen shows all conventional commits
like this picture below:
