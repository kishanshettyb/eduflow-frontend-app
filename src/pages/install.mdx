Getting Started
Install Jest using your yarn package manager:

```
yarn add --dev jest
```

Let's get started by writing a test function that adds two numbers. First,
create a `sum.js `file:

```
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
module.exports = sum;
```

Then, create a file named `sum.test.js.` This will contain our actual test:

```
const sum = require('./sum');

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

Add the following section to your `package.json:`

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

Finally, run `yarn test` and Jest will print this message:

```
PASS  ./sum.test.js
âœ“ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (5ms)
```

You just successfully wrote your first test using Jest!

This test used `expect` and `toBe` to test that two values were exactly identical.
