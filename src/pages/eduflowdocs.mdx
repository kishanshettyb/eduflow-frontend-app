# React Router Structure

## Basic React Router setup

```js copy
import './App.css'
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
import Home from './pages/Home'
import About from './pages/About'
import Profile from './pages/Profile'
import Checkout from './pages/Checkout'
import Login from './pages/Login'
import Maps from './pages/Maps'
import Settings from './pages/Settings'
import Store from './pages/Store'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
        <Route path="/checkout" element={<Checkout />} />
        <Route path="/login" element={<Login />} />
        <Route path="/maps" element={<Maps />} />
        <Route path="/settings" element={<Settings />} />
        <Route path="/store" element={<Store />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  )
}

export default App
```

Although this is acceptable for small projects, when your project scales - this will become incredibly difficult to read and maintain.

So we're going refactor the code into this:

```js copy
import './App.css'
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'
import Router from './pages/router'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Router />
    </BrowserRouter>
  )
}

export default App
```

It's cleaner, scalable and more readble. So let's get started!

Skip this step ðŸ‘‡:

(Already we have project setup so skip this step)

Firstly create our React app in typescript by running the following commands in our terminal:

```js copy
npx create-react-app eduflow-ui --template typescript
cd eduflow-ui
```

Skip this step ðŸ‘†:

## Create the Pages

We're only going to create two pages, Home and About.

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```
mkdir src/pages
mkdir src/pages/Home src/pages/About
touch src/pages/Home/index.tsx src/pages/About/index.tsx
```

## What did we just do?

Created pages directory.
Created two directories inside of pages: `Home` and `About`.
Created `index.tsx files `for Home and About.
Add this to your `pages/About/index.tsx` file:

```
const About = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default About;
```

Add this to your `pages/Home/index.tsx` file:

```
const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

This is pretty self explanatory, we've created two files which represent our pages.

## Creating the types

Let create our types by running the following commands in our terminal:

```
mkdir src/types
touch src/types/router.types.ts
```

Now add this to the newly created types/router.types.ts file:

```
export interface routerType {
  title: string;
  path: string;
  element: JSX.Element;
}
```

## What is happening?

Declare a type for each route:

`titl`e: this will be a `string`
`path`: this will also be a `string`
`element`: this will be a `JSX.Element`

## Why declare types?

You'll see shortly that declaring the types will make sure each time we add a page object, it will follow a strict rule pattern and won't compile any errors.

## Creating the Router

Now we're creating our router.

Run this command in your terminal:

```
touch src/pages/router.tsx src/pages/pagesData.tsx
```

## Pages Data

Add to `pages/pagesData.tsx`:

```
import { routerType } from "../types/router.types";
import About from "./About";
import Home from "./Home";

const pagesData: routerType[] = [
  {
    path: "",
    element: <Home />,
    title: "home"
  },
  {
    path: "about",
    element: <About />,
    title: "about"
  }
];

export default pagesData;
```

## What is happening?

We've imported our `pages` and `types`.
Added a `title`, `path` and `element` to each object.
Every time we want to add a new page, all we have to do is add a new page object into this array. The types will be strict so they must each contain a `title`, `path` and `element`.

## Router File

Add to `pages/router.tsx`

```
import { Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";
import { routerType } from "../types/router.types";
import pagesData from "./pagesData";

const Router = () => {
  const pageRoutes = pagesData.map(({ path, title, element }: routerType) => {
    return <Route key={title} path={`/${path}`} element={element} />;
  });

  return <Routes>{pageRoutes}</Routes>;
};

export default Router;
```

## What is happening?

We're mapping over the pagesData.tsx file and for each object in our data, we are returning a route.

## Update App File

Finally update the App.tsx:

```
import "./App.css";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import Router from "./pages/router";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Router />
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};

export default App;
```
